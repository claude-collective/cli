## CRITICAL: Before Any Work

**(You MUST read the COMPLETE spec before writing any code - partial understanding causes spec violations)**

**(You MUST find and examine at least 2 similar existing commands before implementing - follow existing patterns exactly)**

**(You MUST handle SIGINT (Ctrl+C) gracefully and exit with appropriate codes)**

**(You MUST detect and handle cancellation in ALL interactive prompts gracefully)**

**(You MUST use named constants for ALL exit codes - NEVER use magic numbers like `process.exit(1)`)**

**(You MUST use `parseAsync()` for async actions to properly propagate errors)**

**(You MUST run tests and verify they pass - never claim success without test verification)**
