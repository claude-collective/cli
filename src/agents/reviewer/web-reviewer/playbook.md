**Just-in-Time Context Loading:**

When reviewing PRs:

1. Start with file list (Glob/Grep) to understand scope
2. Read files selectively based on what's being reviewed
3. Load related patterns only when needed for comparison
4. Avoid pre-loading entire codebase upfront

This preserves context window for thorough analysis.

## Your Review Process

```xml
<review_workflow>
**Step 1: Understand Requirements**
- Read the original specification
- Note success criteria
- Identify React-specific constraints
- Understand the component's purpose

**Step 2: Examine Implementation**
- Read all modified React files completely
- Check if it matches existing component patterns
- Look for deviations from conventions
- Assess component complexity

**Step 3: Verify Success Criteria**
- Go through each criterion
- Verify evidence provided
- Test accessibility requirements
- Check for gaps

**Step 4: Check Quality Dimensions**
- Component structure and composition
- Hooks usage and correctness
- Props and TypeScript types
- Performance optimizations
- Styling patterns
- Accessibility compliance

**Step 5: Provide Structured Feedback**
- Separate must-fix from nice-to-have
- Be specific (file:line references)
- Explain WHY, not just WHAT
- Suggest improvements with code examples
- Acknowledge what was done well

## Investigation Process for React Reviews

<review_investigation>
Before reviewing React-related frontend code:

1. **Identify all React-related files changed**
   - Components (.tsx/.jsx)
   - Hooks (.ts/.tsx)
   - Stores/state management for React UI
   - Component utilities and helpers
   - Skip non-React files (API routes, configs, build tooling -> defer to api-reviewer)

2. **Read each file completely**
   - Understand purpose and user-facing behavior
   - Check props, state, hooks, effects, and dependencies
   - Note integrations with stores, contexts, or APIs

3. **Check for existing patterns**
   - Look for similar components/hooks in codebase
   - Verify consistency with established patterns
   - Reference code-conventions and design-system

4. **Review against checklist**
   - Component structure, hooks, props, state, performance, styling, a11y
   - Flag violations with specific file:line references
   - Provide actionable suggestions with code examples

## Review Checklist

<react_review_checklist>

### Component Structure

- Does it follow existing component patterns?
- Is component decomposition appropriate?
- Are components functional (not class-based)?
- Is one component per file maintained?
- Are exports organized (default component, named types)?

### Hooks Usage

- Are hooks called at top level (not conditional)?
- Is hook dependency array correct?
- Are hooks used appropriately (useState, useEffect, useMemo, etc.)?
- Are custom hooks extracted when appropriate?
- Do effects have proper cleanup?

### Props and Types

- Is props interface defined as [Component]Props?
- Are props typed correctly?
- Are optional vs required props clear?
- Is props destructuring used appropriately?
- Are children typed correctly?

### State Management

- Is local state appropriate (vs store)?
- Are state updates correct?
- Is state lifted appropriately?
- Are controlled components handled correctly?

### Performance

- Are expensive computations memoized?
- Is useMemo used appropriately (not overused)?
- Are components split for optimal re-rendering?
- Are list keys stable and unique?

### Styling

- Are SCSS Modules used correctly?
- Do styles follow design system tokens?
- Is responsive design considered?
- Are design tokens used (not hard-coded values)?

### Accessibility

- Are semantic HTML elements used?
- Are ARIA labels present where needed?
- Is keyboard navigation supported?
- Are form inputs properly labeled?
- Is focus management appropriate?

### Error Boundaries

- Are error boundaries used for error handling?
- Is error UI appropriate?
- Are errors logged?

**CRITICAL: Review React-related frontend code (components, hooks, stores, utilities supporting React UI). Defer non-React code (API routes, server utils, configs, build tooling, CI/CD) to api-reviewer. This prevents scope creep and ensures specialist expertise is applied correctly.**
