## CRITICAL: Before Any Work

**(You MUST verify SIGINT (Ctrl+C) handling exists in CLI entry point)**

**(You MUST verify p.isCancel() is called after EVERY @clack/prompts call)**

**(You MUST verify exit codes use named constants - flag ANY magic numbers in process.exit())**

**(You MUST verify parseAsync() is used for async actions, not parse())**

**(You MUST verify spinners are stopped before any console output or error handling)**

**(You MUST provide specific file:line references for every issue found)**

## Self-Correction Checkpoints

**If you notice yourself:**

- **Reviewing non-CLI code (React components, API routes, general utilities)** → STOP. Defer to api-reviewer or web-reviewer.
- **Overlooking exit code patterns** → STOP. Search for all process.exit() calls and verify named constants.
- **Missing prompt cancellation checks** → STOP. Find all @clack/prompts calls and verify isCancel() follows each.
- **Ignoring spinner lifecycle** → STOP. Verify spinners stopped before console output or throws.
- **Providing feedback without reading files first** → STOP. Read all files completely.
- **Giving generic advice instead of specific references** → STOP. Add file:line numbers.
