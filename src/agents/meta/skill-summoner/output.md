## Core Patterns

### Pattern 1: [Name]

[Detailed explanation]

[Use `#### SubsectionName` markdown headers to organize content within patterns as needed. Common subsections include: Constants, Implementation, Usage, Hooks, Configuration - but only include what's relevant for this pattern.]

```[language]
// ✅ Good Example
// Complete, runnable code with explanatory comments
```

**Why good:** [Concise reasoning as comma-separated list - explain the consequence/benefit, not just facts]

```[language]
// ❌ Bad Example - Anti-pattern
// Code showing what NOT to do
```

**Why bad:** [Concise reasoning as comma-separated list - explain what breaks/fails, not just "missing X"]

[OPTIONAL - only include if not obvious from context:]
**When to use:** [Concise scenario - only when the choice isn't self-evident]

**When not to use:** [Concise anti-pattern - only when helpful to clarify boundaries]

### Pattern 2: [Name]

[Continue for all major patterns with embedded good/bad examples...]

<integration>

## Integration Guide (OPTIONAL)

[How this technology integrates with the rest of the stack. Include only when the technology has meaningful interactions with other tools/libraries in your stack.]

**Works with:**

- [Technology X]: [How they integrate]
- [Technology Y]: [How they integrate]

**Replaces / Conflicts with:**

- [Technology Z]: [Why you wouldn't use both]

## Skill Quality Checks

- [ ] Skill directory follows 3-part naming: `{domain}-{category}-{technology}`
- [ ] SKILL.md exists with complete structure
- [ ] metadata.yaml exists with required fields
- [ ] All code examples are syntactically correct
- [ ] Examples follow the patterns described (no contradictions)
- [ ] Usage guidance is specific (not vague "use when needed")
- [ ] SKILL.md has TOC if > 100 lines
- [ ] No overlap with existing skills (checked against: [list])
- [ ] slug field matches the technology portion of the directory name
- [ ] domain field matches the domain portion of the directory name

### SKILL.md (condensed)

```markdown
# MobX State Management Patterns

> **Quick Guide:** Use MobX for complex client state needing computed values and automatic dependency tracking.

<critical_requirements>

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Before Using This Skill

> **All code must follow project conventions in CLAUDE.md**

**(You MUST call `makeAutoObservable(this)` in EVERY store constructor)**
**(You MUST wrap ALL async state updates in `runInAction()`)**
**(You MUST use React Query for server state - NOT MobX)**
</critical_requirements>

<philosophy>
## Philosophy
MobX: "anything that can be derived, should be derived automatically."
**When to use:** Complex client state, computed values, class-based architecture
**When NOT to use:** Server state (React Query), simple UI state (useState/Zustand)
</philosophy>

<patterns>
## Core Patterns

### Pattern 1: Store with makeAutoObservable

​`typescript
// ✅ Good Example
const ACTIVE_STATUS = "active";
class UserStore {
  users: User[] = [];
  constructor() { makeAutoObservable(this); }
  get activeUsers() { return this.users.filter((u) => u.status === ACTIVE_STATUS); }
}
export { UserStore };
​`
**Why good:** makeAutoObservable enables tracking, named constants, named exports

​`typescript
// ❌ Bad Example
class UserStore {
  users = [];
  async fetchUsers() {
    const response = await apiClient.getUsers();
    this.users = response.data; // BAD: Outside action after await
  }
}
export default UserStore; // BAD: Default export
​`
**Why bad:** State mutation after await breaks reactivity, default export violates conventions
</patterns>

<red_flags>

## RED FLAGS

- ❌ Mutating observables outside actions (breaks reactivity)
- ❌ Using MobX for server state (use React Query)
- ⚠️ Not using `observer()` HOC on React components
  **Gotchas:** Code after `await` is NOT part of the action - wrap in `runInAction()`
  </red_flags>

**Failure to follow these rules will break MobX reactivity.**
