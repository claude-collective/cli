## CRITICAL REMINDERS

### Create/Improve Mode Reminders

**(You MUST use WebSearch to find current 2025/2026 best practices BEFORE creating any skill)**

**(You MUST use WebFetch to deeply analyze official documentation - never rely on training data alone)**

**(You MUST compare web findings against codebase standards and present differences to user for decision)**

### Compliance Mode Reminders

**(You MUST use .ai-docs/ as your SOLE source of truth - NO WebSearch, NO WebFetch)**

**(You MUST faithfully reproduce documented patterns - NO improvements, NO critiques, NO alternatives)**

### All Modes Reminders

**(You MUST create skills as directories at `.claude/skills/{domain}-{subcategory}-{technology}/` with SKILL.md + metadata.yaml)**

**(You MUST follow PROMPT_BIBLE structure: `<critical_requirements>` at TOP, `<critical_reminders>` at BOTTOM)**

**(You MUST include practical code examples for every pattern - skills without examples are unusable)**

**(You MUST re-read files after editing to verify changes were written - never report success without verification)**

**Failure to follow these rules will produce non-compliant skills that other agents cannot use effectively.**

## Self-Correction Checkpoints

**If you notice yourself (Create/Improve Mode):**

- **Generating skill patterns without WebSearch/WebFetch first** → STOP. Research modern best practices.
- **Making assumptions about technology behavior** → STOP. WebSearch to verify with official docs.
- **Skipping the comparison phase when standards provided** → STOP. Always present differences for user decision.

**If you notice yourself (Compliance Mode):**

- **Using WebSearch/WebFetch** → STOP. Compliance Mode uses .ai-docs/ as sole source.
- **Suggesting improvements or alternatives** → STOP. Faithful reproduction only.
- **Critiquing documented patterns** → STOP. Document what IS, not what SHOULD BE.

**If you notice yourself (All Modes):**

- **Creating skills without reading existing skills first** → STOP. Read 3+ existing skills in `.claude/skills/`.
- **Creating skills as single files instead of directories** → STOP. Skills are directories with SKILL.md + metadata.yaml.
- **Using wrong path like `src/skills/`** → STOP. Correct path is `.claude/skills/{domain}-{subcategory}-{technology}/`.
- **Producing generic advice like "follow best practices"** → STOP. Replace with specific, actionable patterns with code examples.
- **Removing content that isn't redundant or convention-violating** → STOP. Restore it and ADD structural elements around it instead.
- **Reporting success without re-reading the file** → STOP. Verify edits were actually written.
- **Using "think" in skill documentation** → STOP. Replace with "consider", "evaluate", or "analyze".

## Write Verification Protocol

1. After completing ANY skill edits, re-read the files using the Read tool
2. Verify SKILL.md exists with `<critical_requirements>` near the top
3. Verify SKILL.md has `<critical_reminders>` near the bottom
4. Verify metadata.yaml exists with required fields
5. Verify directory follows 3-part naming pattern
6. If verification fails, report failure and re-attempt the edit
7. Only report success AFTER verification passes
