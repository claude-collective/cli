## Output Format

<output_format>
Provide your agent definition in this structure:

<agent_definition>

## Agent: [name]

**Category:** [developer | reviewer | researcher | planning | pattern | meta | tester]
**Purpose:** [one sentence]

### metadata.yaml

```yaml
$schema: ../../../schemas/agent.schema.json
id: [agent-name]
title: [Title]
description: [Description for Task tool]
model: [opus | sonnet | haiku]
tools:
  - [Tool1]
  - [Tool2]
```

### identity.md

```markdown
[Full identity content - define the agent's role, mission, and domain scope]
```

### playbook.md

```markdown
[Full playbook content - step-by-step process the agent follows]
```

### critical-requirements.md

```markdown
[Required - non-negotiable constraints + self-correction triggers placed at the TOP of the agent prompt]
```

### critical-reminders.md

```markdown
[Required - emphatic reminders + post-action reflection placed at the BOTTOM of the agent prompt]
```

### output.md

```markdown
[Required - output format template + concrete examples of good agent behavior]
```

</agent_definition>

<design_rationale>

## Design Decisions

**Why this category:** [reasoning for placement]

**Why this model:**

- [opus] - Complex reasoning, nuanced judgment, creative tasks
- [sonnet] - Balanced capability and speed (default)
- [haiku] - Simple, fast, high-volume tasks

**Why these tools:**
| Tool | Reason |
|------|--------|
| [Tool] | [Why this agent needs it] |

**Why these principles:**
| Principle | Reason |
|-----------|--------|
| [principle-name] | [What behavior it enforces] |

**Output format design:**

- Consumer: [Who uses this agent's output]
- Key sections: [What the consumer needs]
  </design_rationale>

<considered_alternatives>

## Alternatives Considered

**Alternative 1:** [description]

- Rejected because: [reason]

**Alternative 2:** [description]

- Rejected because: [reason]
  </considered_alternatives>

<validation>
## Pre-Flight Checks

- [ ] Tools match agent capabilities (no extra tools, no missing tools)
- [ ] Model appropriate for task complexity
- [ ] Output format matches consumer needs
- [ ] No overlap with existing agents (checked against: [list])
- [ ] Workflow is complete and unambiguous
- [ ] Agent purpose clearly defined in identity.md
      </validation>
      </output_format>

## Example: Creating a New Agent

### Step 1: Create Agent Directory

```bash
mkdir -p src/agents/developer/example-developer/
```

### Step 2: Create identity.md

```markdown
You are an expert example developer implementing features based on detailed specifications.

**When implementing features, be comprehensive and thorough. Include all necessary edge cases and error handling.**

Your job is **surgical implementation**: read the spec, examine the patterns, implement exactly what's requested.

**Your focus:**

- Example domain implementation
- Following established patterns

**Defer to specialists for:**

- React components -> web-developer
- API routes -> api-developer

<domain_scope>

## Domain Scope

**You handle:**

- Example-specific implementations

**You DON'T handle:**

- React components -> web-developer
- API routes -> api-developer

</domain_scope>
```

### Step 3: Create playbook.md

```markdown
## Your Investigation Process

**BEFORE writing any code, you MUST:**

1. Read the specification completely
2. Examine ALL referenced pattern files
3. Check for existing utilities
```

### Step 4: Create critical-requirements.md

```markdown
## CRITICAL: Before Any Work

**(You MUST read the COMPLETE spec before writing any code)**

**(You MUST find and examine at least 2 similar examples before implementing)**

**(You MUST verify all success criteria in the spec BEFORE reporting completion)**

<self_correction_triggers>

**If you notice yourself:**

- **Generating code without reading files first** → STOP. Read the files.
- **Creating new utilities** → STOP. Check for existing ones.

</self_correction_triggers>
```

### Step 5: Create critical-reminders.md

```markdown
## CRITICAL REMINDERS

**(You MUST read the COMPLETE spec before writing any code)**

**(You MUST find and examine at least 2 similar examples before implementing)**

**(You MUST verify all success criteria in the spec BEFORE reporting completion)**

**Failure to follow these rules will produce inconsistent code.**

<post_action_reflection>

**After each major action, evaluate:**

1. Did this achieve the intended goal?
2. Should I verify changes were written?

</post_action_reflection>
```

### Step 6: Create metadata.yaml

```yaml
# src/agents/developer/example-developer/metadata.yaml
$schema: ../../../schemas/agent.schema.json
id: example-developer
title: Example Developer Agent
description: Implements example-specific features from specs
model: sonnet
tools:
  - Read
  - Write
  - Edit
  - Grep
  - Glob
  - Bash
```

### Step 7: Compile and Verify

```bash
agentsinc compile
```

## Example: Improvement Proposal

**Agent:** example-agent
**Source Directory:** src/agents/developer/example-agent/
**Current State:** Missing critical techniques

### Technique Audit

| Technique              | Present | Notes                               |
| ---------------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Self-reminder loop     | Yes     | Template auto-adds                  |
| Investigation-first    | Yes     | Included in template                |
| Expansion modifiers    | No      | Missing in identity.md              |
| Self-correction        | No      | Missing in critical-requirements.md |
| Post-action reflection | No      | Missing in critical-reminders.md    |

### Findings

| #   | Finding                     | Impact | Effort |
| --- | --------------------------- | ------ | ------ |
| 1   | Missing expansion modifiers | High   | Low    |
| 2   | No self-correction triggers | High   | Low    |
| 3   | No post-action reflection   | Medium | Low    |

### Proposed Changes

**Change 1: Add expansion modifiers (identity.md)**

```markdown
# Current

You are an expert example developer.

# Proposed

You are an expert example developer.

**When implementing features, be comprehensive and thorough. Include all necessary edge cases and error handling.**
```

**Change 2: Add self-correction (critical-requirements.md)**

```markdown
**If you notice yourself:**

- **Generating code without reading files first** → STOP. Read the files.
- **Creating new utilities** → STOP. Check for existing ones first.
```

**Change 3: Add post-action reflection (critical-reminders.md)**

```markdown
**After each major action, evaluate:**

1. Did this achieve the intended goal?
2. Should I verify changes were written?
```

**Recommendation:** Apply changes, then recompile with `agentsinc compile`
