---

## CRITICAL PRINCIPLE — READ BEFORE WRITING ANY TEST

**This codebase contains known bugs. All tests passing is a red flag, not a goal.**

The purpose of E2E tests is to surface bugs, not to produce a green dashboard. Rules:

1. **Write correct assertions.** Assert exactly what the CLI _should_ do, not what it _currently_ does.
2. **If a test fails, that's a FINDING.** Do NOT weaken the assertion to make it pass.
3. **Use `it.fails()` for known bugs.** This documents the expected behavior AND keeps the suite green.
4. **Never accept multiple outcomes.** No `expect(output).toMatch(/success|error|failure/)`. Each test asserts ONE specific outcome.
5. **Never update tests to make them pass.** If the CLI doesn't match the assertion, the CLI has a bug. Document it and use `it.fails()`.

---

## Phase 9: Coverage Expansion + Assertion Audit

Expand thin command tests and audit ALL existing tests for weak/multi-outcome assertions.

### Assertion audit (review all existing tests)

- [x] Scan ALL test files for multi-outcome regex patterns (e.g., `/a|b|c/`)
- [x] Scan ALL test files for `toBeGreaterThan(0)` on output length
- [x] Verify every `execa` call with `reject: false` has an `exitCode` assertion
- [x] Split any multi-outcome tests into separate specific tests

### `update` command (now 9 tests)

- [x] Fix: split "up to date" test into specific assertions per outcome
- [x] Add: `skill` arg not found → "Did you mean" suggestions
- [x] Add: `skill` arg is `local-only` → "Cannot update local-only skills"
- [x] Add: `--no-recompile` flag → verify no "Recompiling agents" in output

### `import skill` command (now 10 tests, 5 `it.fails()` — local source bug)

- [x] Add: `--skill` and `--all` together → mutual exclusion error
- [x] Add: `--subdir` with absolute path → error (`it.fails()`)
- [x] Add: local source with `--list` → verify skill listing format (`it.fails()`)
- [x] Add: local source with `--skill <name>` → verify import output (`it.fails()`)
- [x] Add: import same skill twice without `--force` → verify skip warning (`it.fails()`)
- [x] Add: `--force` with existing skill → verify overwrite succeeds (`it.fails()`)

### `build plugins` command (now 5 tests)

- [x] Add: `--skill` flag with nonexistent path → error
- [x] Add: `--output-dir` flag → custom output path
- [x] Add: `--verbose` flag → accepted (exit 0)
- [ ] Add: `--skills-dir` flag → accepted (deferred — needs installed project fixture)

### `build marketplace` command (now 4 tests)

- [x] Add: `--output` flag → custom output path
- [x] Add: `--name` flag → custom name in output
- [ ] Add: `--verbose` flag → accepted (exit 0) (deferred — duplicate of plugins --verbose)

### `new agent` command (now 5 tests)

- [x] Add: `--help` verifies `--refresh` flag in output
- [x] Add: `Output:` path line includes `_custom` dir path

### `doctor` command (now 11 tests)

- [x] Add: `--verbose` flag → additional detail in output
- [x] Add: valid config + local source → "Connected to local:" with skill count
- [x] Add: config with agents compiled → "Agents Compiled" pass
- [x] Add: orphaned agent files → "No Orphans" warning

### `eject` command (now 11 tests)

- [x] Add: `eject skills` with local source → "N skills ejected"
- [x] Add: `eject all` → all three phases complete
- [x] Add: `--source` flag → source saved to project config
- [x] Add: minimal config.yaml creation after eject

---

## Phase 10: Test Gaps + Infrastructure Improvements

Identified by cross-referencing CLI commands with existing test coverage and auditing shared infrastructure for DRY opportunities.

### Infrastructure improvements (from shared helper audit)

- [x] Extract shared filesystem utilities (`createTempDir`, `cleanupTempDir`, `fileExists`, `directoryExists`) to a common module importable by both E2E and unit test helpers (Finding 30)
- [x] Simplify `cleanupTempDir` in both E2E and unit helpers — replace manual retry loop with `fs.rm` built-in `maxRetries: 3, retryDelay: 100` options (Finding 36)
- [x] Add `runCLI()` wrapper to `test-utils.ts` to reduce execa + stripAnsi boilerplate across 17 command test files (Finding 38)
- [x] Replace magic exit code integers with `EXIT_CODES.*` constants from `src/cli/lib/exit-codes.ts` across all E2E test files (~150 bare `toBe(0)`, `toBe(1)`, `toBe(2)`, `toBe(3)` assertions). Re-export `EXIT_CODES` from `e2e/helpers/test-utils.ts` and add `OCLIF_EXIT_CODES.UNKNOWN_COMMAND = 127` for the oclif-specific code.

### `config` command gaps (currently 16 tests)

- [x] `list` with multiple skills installed → verify all listed (`it.fails()` — CLI shows counts only, not individual IDs)
- [ ] `list` with both CLI-managed and user-created skills → verify distinction in output

### `new agent` command gaps (currently 5 tests)

- [ ] `new agent` with `--refresh` flag → verify refresh behavior (if testable without Claude API)
- [ ] `new agent` with invalid name (spaces, special chars) → verify validation error

### `uninstall` command gaps (currently 8 non-interactive tests)

- [x] `uninstall --help` output includes `--dry-run` flag documentation
- [ ] `uninstall --dry-run --all` → verify dry-run with --all flag

- [ ] `validate` with duplicate skill IDs across categories → verify warning/error

### `search` interactive gaps (currently 14 tests, 1 `it.fails()`)

- [ ] Search with arrow key navigation → verify selected result highlighting
- [ ] Search with Enter on a result → verify info display or action
- [ ] Search with multiple pages of results → verify scrolling behavior
- [ ] Search with `--source` flag in non-interactive mode → verify source override works (unlike interactive mode, see Finding 15)

- [ ] Init from "Start from scratch" with only one domain selected → verify single-domain flow
- [ ] Init with all domains deselected → verify validation error or empty install behavior
- [ ] Init with stack selection → customize instead of defaults → verify build step loads stack skills
- [x] Init in a directory with existing `.claude/` but no config → verify behavior (starts fresh wizard)
- [ ] Init on existing project → dashboard menu (see Phase 12)

### `edit wizard` interactive gaps (currently 17 tests)

- [ ] Interactive update with outdated skills → verify selection UI appears
- [ ] Interactive update selection → select specific skills → verify only selected are updated
- [ ] Interactive update with `--source` flag → verify source override in interactive mode

### Missing command-level tests (commands with zero or only --help tests)

All commands have at least basic coverage. The following have the thinnest coverage relative to their complexity:

- [ ] `import skill` — 5 of 10 tests are `it.fails()` due to local source bug. Once BUG is fixed, convert to passing tests.
- [ ] `build stack` interactive — no test verifies the actual compiled output content (only verifies compilation started/completed)

---

## Phase 12: Missing Journeys — Global Install, Dashboard, Wizard Toggles

Cross-referenced all CLI commands, flags, wizard key handlers, and recent features against existing E2E coverage. These are user journeys that have no E2E test.

### Global install scope (`--global` flag + `G` key toggle)

- [ ] `init --global` creates config in `~/.claude-src/config.yaml` and skills in `~/.claude/skills/`
- [ ] `init --global --dry-run` shows global install preview without writing files
- [ ] `init --global` with existing global config shows dashboard (not re-init)
- [ ] `G` key during init wizard toggles scope badge to "Global"
- [ ] `edit` falls back to global installation when no project config exists
- [ ] `list` shows global installation details when no project config exists
- [ ] `doctor` validates global installation when no project config exists
- [ ] `compile` uses global installation paths when no project config exists

### Dashboard view (init on existing project)

- [ ] `init` on already-initialized project shows dashboard menu
- [ ] Dashboard renders installed skill count, agent names, config path
- [ ] Dashboard arrow key navigation between options (Edit, Compile, Doctor, List)
- [ ] Dashboard ESC or Ctrl+C exits cleanly

### Wizard toggle badges

- [ ] `P` key during init wizard toggles "Plugin mode" badge active/inactive
- [ ] `G` key during init wizard toggles "Global" badge active/inactive
- [ ] `D` key during build step toggles compatibility labels on skill tags
- [ ] `?` key opens help modal, ESC closes it
- [ ] `S` key during sources step opens settings overlay

### Stack skill restoration on domain re-toggle

- [ ] Stack-based init: deselect a domain, re-select it — skills from stack restore
- [ ] Scratch flow: deselect a domain, re-select it — no automatic restoration

### Startup message buffering (D-28)

- [ ] `init --global` shows "Installing globally..." message above wizard (not cleared by Ink)
- [ ] `edit` with global fallback shows "No project installation found..." message above wizard

### Confirm step detail verification

- [ ] Confirm step displays install mode (Plugin/Local)
- [ ] Confirm step displays install scope (Global/Project)
- [ ] Confirm step displays selected skills grouped by domain
- [ ] Confirm step displays selected agents

### Source management in wizard

- [ ] `S` key in sources step opens settings overlay with source list
- [ ] `A` key in settings adds a new source
- [ ] DEL key in settings removes a non-default source
- [ ] ESC in settings returns to sources step

### Missing flag combinations

- [ ] `init --global --source {url}` uses custom source for global install
- [ ] `edit --source {url}` loads skills from custom source
- [ ] `compile --agent-source {url}` compiles agents from custom remote source

---

## Phase 11: Integration Test Cleanup

Now that E2E tests cover real CLI flows end-to-end, several integration tests that call internal functions directly are redundant. These should be reviewed and deleted once E2E tests have proven stable over multiple CI runs.

### High redundancy — candidates for deletion

These test the same flows that E2E tests now cover more thoroughly through the real CLI binary:

- [ ] `src/cli/lib/__tests__/integration/init-end-to-end.integration.test.ts` — wizard store → installLocal() pipeline. Fully covered by `e2e/interactive/init-wizard.e2e.test.ts`.
- [ ] `src/cli/lib/__tests__/integration/init-flow.integration.test.ts` — init flow with skills copying, agent compilation, config generation. Fully covered by `e2e/interactive/init-wizard.e2e.test.ts`.
- [ ] `src/cli/lib/__tests__/integration/wizard-init-compile-pipeline.test.ts` — wizard → init → compile pipeline. Covered by E2E init-wizard + compile tests.
- [ ] `src/cli/lib/__tests__/user-journeys/compile-flow.test.ts` — compile command with skill discovery, frontmatter, dry-run. Covered by `e2e/commands/compile.e2e.test.ts`.
- [ ] `src/cli/lib/__tests__/user-journeys/user-journeys.integration.test.ts` — multi-journey scenarios (init → edit → recompile). Covered by E2E init-wizard + edit-wizard tests.

### Moderate redundancy — reduce after E2E coverage strengthened

These overlap with E2E on the happy path but test internal logic (recompilation mechanics, stack compilation details) that E2E doesn't deeply validate:

- [ ] `src/cli/lib/__tests__/integration/compilation-pipeline.test.ts` — skill/stack/marketplace compilation logic. E2E covers happy path only.
- [ ] `src/cli/lib/__tests__/user-journeys/edit-recompile.test.ts` — recompilation mechanics (skill change detection, determinism). E2E covers UI flow, not recompile details.
- [ ] `src/cli/lib/__tests__/user-journeys/install-compile.test.ts` — stack plugin compilation (manifest, versioning, README). E2E covers interactive flow, not output details.

### Keep — no E2E equivalent exists

These test foundational logic that E2E tests assume works but never directly validate:

- `src/cli/lib/__tests__/integration/consumer-stacks-matrix.integration.test.ts` — stack loading, precedence, matrix merging, skill relationships
- `src/cli/lib/__tests__/integration/import-skill.integration.test.ts` — only comprehensive test of import workflow (E2E import tests are blocked by local source bug)
- `src/cli/lib/__tests__/integration/installation.test.ts` — installation detection logic (local/plugin mode, legacy fallback, precedence)
- `src/cli/lib/__tests__/integration/source-switching.integration.test.ts` — archive/restore mechanics for source switching
- `src/cli/lib/__tests__/user-journeys/config-precedence.test.ts` — config resolution precedence (flag → env → project → default)
