# Release 0.16.0 (2026-02-07)

## Changed

- **Wizard flow simplified** - Removed the intermediate "stack-options" step; selecting a stack now goes directly to the build step with pre-populated technology selections. Flow is now: approach -> stack -> build -> refine -> confirm
- **ViewTitle component** - Simplified API from `title` string prop to `children` for flexible composition
- **Build step header** - Replaced domain tab header with ViewTitle showing "Customise your {Domain} stack"
- **Build step legend** - Simplified color legend from background-colored badges to plain colored text
- **CategoryGrid styling** - Skill tags now use border-based styling instead of background colors; removed section header underlines

## Added

- **Accept defaults shortcut** - Press `A` during build step (stack path only) to skip customization and continue with stack defaults
- **All-domain cycling** - Stack selection now includes all five domains (web, api, cli, mobile, shared) in the build step, even if the stack only covers some

## Fixed

- **Local skill category preservation** - When a local skill overwrites a remote skill, the remote skill's domain-based category is now preserved instead of falling back to "local/custom"

## Removed

- **StepStackOptions component** - Eliminated intermediate step between stack selection and technology customization
