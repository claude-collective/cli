# Release 0.8.0 (2026-02-02)

## Breaking Changes

- **Skill IDs normalized to kebab-case** - Skill IDs changed from path-based format with author suffix (e.g., `web/framework/react (@vince)`) to simple kebab-case (e.g., `web-framework-react`). Consumer configs and any code referencing old skill IDs must be updated.

## Added

- **Meta-stack** - New stack for meta-level development with 5 agents (skill-summoner, agent-summoner, documentor, pattern-scout, web-pattern-critique) mapped to methodology and research skills.

## Changed

- `skill_aliases` in skills-matrix.yaml now map to normalized kebab-case IDs
- `DEFAULT_PRESELECTED_SKILLS` updated to use new ID format
- Simplified `skill-copier.ts`, `skill-plugin-compiler.ts`, `marketplace-generator.ts` - removed path parsing logic

## Removed

- `normalizeSkillId()` function - no longer needed since frontmatter contains canonical IDs

## Fixed

- **Uninstall command terminal state** - Added proper `exit()` calls to restore terminal after confirmation
