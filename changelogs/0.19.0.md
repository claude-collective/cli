# Release 0.19.0 (2026-02-07)

## Changed

- **Removed top-level categories from skills matrix** - Top-level categories (`frontend`, `backend`, `setup`, `cli`, `mobile`, `reviewing`, `methodology`, `research`, `shared`, `local`) and the `parent` field on subcategories have been removed. The wizard already operated entirely on the `domain` field; the top-level layer added no value.
- **Aligned agent mapping patterns with domains** - Category path patterns in skill-agent-mappings renamed: `frontend/*` -> `web/*`, `backend/*` -> `api/*`, `setup/*` -> `infra/*`. YAML defaults and marketplace generator updated to match.
- **Renamed `frontend/realtime` to `realtime`** - Composite subcategory ID simplified to match the `^[a-z][a-z0-9-]*$` schema pattern.
- **Stacks alias renamed** - `backend-testing` -> `api-testing` in stacks.yaml.

## Added

- **New web categories** - `animation`, `pwa`, `accessibility`, `web-performance` for skills previously bucketed under the removed `frontend` top-level.
- **New shared categories** - `methodology`, `research`, `reviewing`, `ci-cd` for meta and infrastructure skills.

## Removed

- **`parent` field** from `CategoryDefinition` type and JSON schema.
- **`getSubcategories()` and `getTopLevelCategories()`** from matrix-resolver (unused in production code).
