# Release 0.6.0 (2026-02-01)

## Breaking Changes

- **Skills now defined in stacks, not agents** - Previously, each agent YAML contained a `skills` field. Now, stacks define technology selections per agent in `config/stacks.yaml`. Skills are resolved via `skill_aliases` in the skills matrix. This fixes the bug where stacks got wrong skills (e.g., angular-stack getting React skills).
- **stacks.yaml schema changed** - Agents are now objects with subcategory->technology mappings (e.g., `web-developer: { framework: react, styling: scss-modules }`) instead of simple string lists.
- **Removed `skills` field from agent schema** - Agent YAMLs no longer contain skill definitions.

## Added

- **`stack` property in consumer config.yaml** - When a stack is selected, the resolved agent->skill mappings are stored in the project config for reproducibility.
- **`resolveAgentSkillsFromStack()`** - New function in resolver.ts to extract skills from stack configurations.
- **`resolveStackSkillsFromAliases()`** - New function in stacks-loader.ts to resolve technology selections to skill IDs via the matrix.
- **Phase 7 UX specification** - Comprehensive documentation for upcoming wizard UX redesign with domain-based navigation and grid-based skill selection.

## Changed

- `loadStackById()` now reads technology selections per agent from the new stacks.yaml format
- `getAgentSkills()` now accepts optional `stack` and `skillAliases` parameters for Phase 7 skill resolution
- `stackToResolvedStack()` extracts skills from stack configurations instead of agent YAMLs
- Stack plugin compiler now extracts skills via matrix aliases

## Removed

- `skills` field from all 18 agent YAMLs - skills now come from stacks
- `skills` property from agent.schema.json
