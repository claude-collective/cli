# Release 0.29.4 (2026-02-15)

## Fixed

- **Strict JSON schema validation** -- All 12 generated JSON schemas now enforce meaningful constraints for IDE autocomplete and validation via `yaml-language-server`. Previously, schemas like `project-config` accepted anything due to `.passthrough()` and missing `required` fields.
  - Hook definitions require `hooks` array with at least 1 action
  - Agent `tools` requires at least 1 entry
  - Marketplace `name`/`version` reject empty strings; `plugins` requires at least 1 entry
  - Stack `id`/`name` reject empty strings; `stacks` array requires at least 1 entry
  - Relationship rules enforce minimum skill counts (`conflicts`/`discourages` need 2+)
  - Plugin manifest uses strict validation schema (rejects unknown fields)
  - Project config and source config use dedicated validation schemas with `required` fields and `additionalProperties: false`
