# Release 0.36.0 (2026-02-18)

## Added

- Tier-based source sort order in the Sources step: local → scoped marketplace → default public → third-party
- `primary` flag on `SkillSource` type to distinguish scoped marketplace from third-party sources
- `DEFAULT_PUBLIC_SOURCE_NAME` centralized constant in `consts.ts`
- `createMockExtractedSkill()` test factory in helpers.ts
- `buildPipelineMatrix()` DRY helper in wizard-init-compile-pipeline tests
- CLAUDE.md rules: no unnecessary comments, no constant reassignment aliases
- Research docs for auto-version-check, uninstall redesign, and user-defined stacks

## Changed

- Sources step now renders full skill display names (matching the Build step) instead of last ID segment fallback
- Source sort order is fixed across all contexts (no selected-source promotion)
- Replaced raw `Object.keys` with `typedKeys` across production and test code
- Added `getErrorMessage()` to all catch blocks missing it
- Replaced raw `mkdtemp`/`rm` with `createTempDir`/`cleanupTempDir` in test files
- Replaced local `pathExists` with shared `fileExists`/`directoryExists` from helpers
- Imported `CLAUDE_DIR`/`CLAUDE_SRC_DIR` from `consts.ts` instead of redefining locally
- Renamed `RETRY_DELAYS` to `RETRY_DELAYS_MS` for unit clarity
- Removed section separator comments, WHAT comments, and restating JSDoc across ~30 files
- Removed task tracking IDs from test describe blocks
- Added boundary cast comments where missing

## Fixed

- Tailwind v3 skill rendering as "v3" instead of "Tailwind CSS v3" in Sources step
- Radix UI and similar multi-word skills truncated to last segment in Sources step
