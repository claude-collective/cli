# Release 0.24.6 (2026-02-12)

## Changed

- **Codebase-wide comment cleanup** -- Removed AI-generated banner separators (`// ====...`), obvious JSDoc that restated function/variable names, file-level header comments, and verbose multi-line blocks across 150+ files (~5,600 lines removed). Comments explaining WHY, boundary casts, edge cases, and TODOs preserved.
- **Standardized JSDoc on all type definitions** -- All exported types in `src/cli/types/` now use consistent `/** */` JSDoc format. Union grouping comments kept as `//`. Obvious property comments removed, meaningful annotations (`@default`, deprecation, logic notes) preserved.
- **Unused imports cleaned up** -- Removed unused `beforeEach` in `plugin-finder.test.ts` and unused `readdir` in `agent-recompiler.test.ts`.
