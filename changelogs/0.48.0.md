# Release 0.48.0 (2026-02-27)

## Added

- **E2E test infrastructure** — Full PTY-based end-to-end test suite with `TerminalSession` for interactive wizard testing, `createE2ESource` fixture for source-based command tests, and 264 E2E tests covering all CLI commands and interactive flows.

## Changed

- **Matrix decomposition** — Split monolithic `skills-matrix.yaml` into `config/skill-categories.yaml` (category definitions with `exclusive` flag) and `config/skill-rules.yaml` (relationships, aliases). Skills are now discovered from source directories via `extractAllSkills()` instead of being declared inline in the matrix.
- **`cliName` renamed to `displayName`** — The `cliName` field in skill `metadata.yaml` is now `displayName` across all schemas, loaders, validators, and commands. The JSON schema (`metadata.schema.json`) is updated accordingly.
- **`categoryExclusive` removed from skill metadata** — Per-skill `categoryExclusive` field removed from types, schemas, and all loaders. Exclusivity is now driven entirely by the `exclusive` flag on category definitions in `skill-categories.yaml`.
- **Missing `displayName` is a hard error** — Both `extractAllSkills()` (source loader) and `discoverLocalSkills()` (local loader) now throw when a skill's `metadata.yaml` is missing the required `displayName` field, instead of silently skipping.
- **README rewrite** — Reframed README as agent composition framework documentation.

## Removed

- **`categoryExclusive` field** — Removed from `ResolvedSkill`, `ExtractedSkillMetadata`, `SkillMetadataConfig`, and all related schemas.
- **Inline skills-matrix.yaml** — Replaced by decomposed `skill-categories.yaml` + `skill-rules.yaml` + directory-based skill discovery.
