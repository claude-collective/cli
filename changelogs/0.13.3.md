# Release 0.13.3 (2026-02-06)

## Fixed

- **local config not found during recompile** - `recompileAgents` only looked for config in the plugin directory, missing local mode configs in the project directory. now falls back to project directory when plugin dir has no config
- **agent_skills normalization** - `agent_skills` from project config was passed to the compiler without normalizing mixed formats (string arrays vs object maps), causing compilation failures
