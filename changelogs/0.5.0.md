# Release 0.5.0 (2026-02-01)

## Breaking Changes

- **Agent-centric configuration** - skills are now defined in agent YAMLs instead of stack config files. Stacks are now simple agent groupings in `config/stacks.yaml`. This is a significant architectural change that simplifies configuration but requires migration for custom stacks.

## Added

- **Skills in agent YAMLs** - each agent now defines its own skills with a `preloaded` flag to control what's included in the agent prompt
- **Centralized stacks.yaml** - all 7 stacks (nextjs-fullstack, angular, nuxt, remix, vue, solidjs, react-native) are now defined in `config/stacks.yaml` with agent lists and philosophy
- **stacks-loader** - new module to load stacks from config/stacks.yaml
- **resolveAgentSkills()** - function to extract skills from agent definitions

## Changed

- `loadStackById()` now loads from `config/stacks.yaml` (new format) instead of `src/stacks/*/config.yaml`
- `getAgentSkills()` priority order: compile config > agent skills > stack-based (legacy)
- `stackToResolvedStack()` now extracts skill IDs from agent definitions
- `build:stack` command deprecated (shows warning and exits)

## Removed

- Stack config files (`src/stacks/*/config.yaml`) - skills now come from agent YAMLs
- `suggested_stacks` section from `skills-matrix.yaml` - moved to `stacks.yaml`

## Internal

- Updated all 17 agent YAMLs with skills fields
- Deprecated `skill-agent-mappings.ts` (kept for wizard fallback)
- Updated tests to work with new stack format (passing Stack objects instead of writing config files)
