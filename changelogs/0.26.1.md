# Release 0.26.1 (2026-02-13)

## Fixed

- **Metadata version coercion** -- `cc build plugins` no longer warns on `version: 1` in metadata.yaml. Added lenient `skillMetadataLoaderSchema` that coerces YAML numeric versions to strings.
- **Stack lookup from source in plugin mode** -- `compileStackPlugin` now resolves stacks from the source's `config/stacks.yaml` before falling back to the CLI's built-in stacks. Fixes "stack not found" error when running `cc init --source` with a private marketplace in plugin mode.
- **Skills matrix fallback** -- Stack compiler gracefully falls back to CLI matrix when the source's `config/skills-matrix.yaml` is missing or invalid.
