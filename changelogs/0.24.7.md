# Release 0.24.7 (2026-02-12)

## Added

- **Sources step in wizard flow** -- New step between Build and Confirm lets users choose between recommended skills (verified by Claude Collective) or customizing skill sources per technology. Wizard tabs updated to 5 steps.
- **Edit command starts at Build step** -- `cc edit` now skips Intro/Stack and opens directly at the Build step with currently installed skills pre-populated via new `populateFromSkillIds` store action.

## Changed

- **Parse boundary error handling hardened across 11 files** -- All `verbose()` calls for malformed user-facing data (project config, local skills, default mappings, skill metadata) promoted to `warn()` so errors are visible without `--verbose`. Bare `JSON.parse` in skill import wrapped in try/catch. Empty `catch {}` in permission checker now warns on malformed `settings.json`. Manual frontmatter parsing in `compile.ts` replaced with `parseFrontmatter()` utility. Missing `name` field in project config now falls back to directory name with a warning.
- **Marketplace list JSON parsing hardened** -- `claudePluginMarketplaceList` now validates JSON parse and array type before returning.

## Refactored

- **Replaced pseudo-agents pattern with `populateFromSkillIds`** -- Stack selection no longer constructs fake agent objects to feed into `populateFromStack`. New `populateFromSkillIds` store action maps skill IDs directly to domain/subcategory selections with warnings for missing or unresolvable skills.
