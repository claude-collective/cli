# Release 0.31.1 (2026-02-16)

## Added

- **Commit protocol documentation** — `docs/commit-protocol.md` provides reference guide for AI agents making commits, covering conventional commit format, co-author rules, sequential commit testing strategy, split-file changelog architecture, and version bumping guidelines.
- **Project configuration** — Added `.claude-src/config.yaml` with full agent and skill configuration for this CLI project.
- **Hackathon planning** — Added `todo hackathon.md` with 21 tasks across comms and development categories for upcoming work.

## Changed

- **TODO.md updates** — Added U16 task for migrating to split-file changelog architecture, marked U12 (CLAUDE.md) as DONE.

## Documentation

This release establishes the commit protocol that will be used for all future releases, implementing a safer split-file changelog architecture where each release gets its own detailed file in `changelogs/` and the main `CHANGELOG.md` becomes a summary index with links.
