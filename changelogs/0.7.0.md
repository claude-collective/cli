# Release 0.7.0 (2026-02-02)

## Breaking Changes

- **Wizard flow redesigned** - New 5-step flow: Approach -> Stack -> Build -> Refine -> Confirm. The old category -> subcategory linear flow is replaced with domain-based grid selection.

## Added

- **Domain-based navigation** - Categories now have a `domain` field (web, api, cli, mobile, shared) for filtering in the Build step
- **CategoryGrid component** - 2D grid selection with keyboard navigation (arrows, vim keys h/j/k/l), visual states (selected, recommended, discouraged, disabled)
- **WizardTabs component** - Horizontal 5-step progress indicator with completed/current/pending/skipped states
- **SectionProgress component** - Sub-step progress for multi-domain flows
- **StepBuild component** - Grid-based technology selection per domain, replaces linear category/subcategory flow
- **StepRefine component** - Skill source selection (verified skills, customize coming soon)
- **StepStackOptions component** - Options after stack selection (continue defaults or customize)
- **CLI domain support** - New `cli` category in skills-matrix with framework, prompts, testing subcategories
- **Wizard store v2** - Complete rewrite with history-based navigation, domain selections, grid focus state

## Changed

- `wizard.tsx` - Complete rewrite as orchestrator for new 5-step flow
- `step-approach.tsx` - Updated for v2 store
- `step-stack.tsx` - Now dual-purpose: stack selection (stack path) or domain selection (scratch path)
- `step-confirm.tsx` - Updated to show domain breakdown, technology/skill counts
- `wizard-store.ts` - Migrated to v2 state shape with approach, selectedDomains, domainSelections, stackAction, focusedRow/Col

## Removed

- `step-category.tsx` - Replaced by StepBuild with CategoryGrid
- `step-subcategory.tsx` - Replaced by StepBuild with CategoryGrid
- `selection-header.tsx` - No longer needed

## Fixed

- **Skill resolution for stack defaults** - Selecting a stack with "Continue with defaults" now correctly includes all stack skills (was only including methodology skills)
- **Display names in Build step** - Technologies now show clean names ("React") instead of full IDs ("React (@vince)")
