# Release 0.21.0 (2026-02-09)

## Changed

- **Removed refine wizard step** - The 5-step wizard flow (approach -> stack -> build -> refine -> confirm) is now 4 steps (approach -> stack -> build -> confirm). The refine step for skill source selection has been removed; `refineAction` state and `setRefineAction` action removed from wizard store.
- **Build step layout** - Domain tabs header shows all selected domains with active domain highlighted; legend row simplified from positioned overlay to inline flex layout.

## Added

- **`web-extras` domain** - 8 categories (error-handling, file-upload, files, utilities, realtime, animation, pwa, accessibility) split from `web` into a new `web-extras` domain to reduce vertical height in the build view.
- **`parent_domain` field** on `CategoryDefinition` - Sub-domains inherit framework-first filtering from their parent domain (e.g., `web-extras` respects `web`'s framework selection).
- **`parentDomainSelections` prop** on `StepBuild` - Passes parent domain selections for framework compatibility filtering in sub-domains.
