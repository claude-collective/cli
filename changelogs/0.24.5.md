# Release 0.24.5 (2026-02-11)

## Added

- **Command tests for all 12 previously untested CLI commands** -- ~158 new tests across 9 test files covering config:set-project, config:unset-project, version (index), version:set, version:bump, new:skill, new:agent, import:skill, update, uninstall, init, and edit. Total test count: 1512 passing (up from ~1344).
- **Vitest auto-mocks for fs and logger** -- Manual mock files (`src/cli/utils/__mocks__/fs.ts`, `logger.ts`) replace inline `vi.mock()` factory functions across 15 existing test files. `clearMocks: true` enabled globally.
- **Vitest test projects** -- Config split into 3 projects (`unit`, `integration`, `commands`) for clearer test organization and selective running.

## Changed

- **`docs/architecture.md` expanded** to comprehensive reference covering project structure, data flow, domain organization, type system, Zod validation, CLI commands, wizard components, test infrastructure, utility patterns, and conventions.
- **`docs/index.md` updated** with bibles section and UX research section.

## Removed

- **21 outdated documentation files removed** -- Completed migration plans (Commander.js->oclif), implemented feature plans (skill-id normalization, Phase 7 wizard redesign, init refactor), superseded research (integration testing, oclif ecosystem evaluation, CLI improvements), and resolved UX research. `cli-command-testing-plan.md` also removed (all tests implemented). Bibles and active UX research retained.
