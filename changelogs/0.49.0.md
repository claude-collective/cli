# Release 0.49.0 (2026-02-27)

## Added

- **Config file generation in `new skill` and `new marketplace`** — `new marketplace` scaffolds `config/skill-categories.yaml` and `config/skill-rules.yaml` during initial creation. `new skill` creates or appends to these config files when running in marketplace context (marketplace.json present), ensuring new skills have proper category definitions and alias entries.
- **E2E tests for config file generation** — 4 new E2E tests verifying marketplace scaffold includes both config files and skill creation updates them in marketplace context.
- **Unit tests for generators** — 18 new unit tests covering `generateSkillCategoriesYaml()`, `generateSkillRulesYaml()`, domain inference, displayName derivation, and duplicate-entry prevention.

## Changed

- **Matrix decomposition Phase 6 complete** — All 8 phases of D-50 are now done. The `new skill` and `new marketplace` commands are the final integration point, completing the decomposition of `skills-matrix.yaml`.
