# Release 0.43.0 (2026-02-21)

## Removed

- Removed legacy `version` command group (`version:show`, `version:bump`, `version:set`) — redundant with build plugins auto-versioning
- Removed `version` integer field from skill metadata schemas, types, and loaders — was parsed but never used
- Removed ghost-reference checks from matrix health check — skills referencing non-present skills is expected for marketplace sources

## Changed

- Matrix health check now only validates structural issues: missing category domains and unknown skill categories
