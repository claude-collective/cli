# Release 0.24.4 (2026-02-11)

## Changed

- **`lib/` restructured into domain subdirectories** -- 62 files moved from flat `lib/` into 8 domain-organized subdirectories: `configuration/`, `loading/`, `matrix/`, `plugins/`, `skills/`, `agents/`, `stacks/`, `installation/`. Each domain has a barrel `index.ts` for clean imports. Cross-cutting files (`compiler`, `resolver`, `schemas`, etc.) remain at `lib/` root. ~140 import paths updated across commands, components, hooks, and tests.
