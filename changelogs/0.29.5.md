# Release 0.29.5 (2026-02-15)

## Fixed

- **Local yaml-language-server schema paths** -- All 22 YAML/MD files with `$schema` comments pointed to relative local paths (e.g. `../../../schemas/agent.schema.json`) which only resolve inside this repo. Replaced with `raw.githubusercontent.com` URLs so schemas resolve in any consumer project. Added `agent`, `skillsMatrix`, and `stacks` entries to `SCHEMA_PATHS` constant.
