# Release 0.13.4 (2026-02-06)

## Fixed

- **local skills lose category metadata** - Local skills from `.claude/skills/` were hardcoded to `category: "local/custom"`, destroying their original category (e.g., `"framework"`, `"styling"`). This broke framework pre-selection in the wizard's Build step and domain filtering. Now preserves the original category from `metadata.yaml` when it matches a matrix category, and carries forward aliases and relationships from source skills.
