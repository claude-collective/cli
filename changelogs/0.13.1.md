# Release 0.13.1 (2026-02-06)

## Fixed

- **npx eject fails with ENOENT** - `config/` directory (skills-matrix.yaml, stacks.yaml) was missing from the published npm package, causing `npx @claude-collective/cli eject all` to fail
- **Build copies config to dist** - `config/` is now copied to `dist/config/` during build for correct runtime path resolution
- **Test suite portability** - Integration tests that depend on the external claude-subagents repo are now gated behind `CC_TEST_SKILLS_SOURCE` env var
- **macOS temp path mismatch** - Fixed `/private/var` vs `/var` symlink issue in installation test
- **Pre-commit hook** - Changed `bun test` to `bun run test` to use vitest instead of bun's built-in test runner
