## What Was Wrong

The `desktop-storage-electron` skill had `category: desktop-framework` in its `metadata.yaml` instead of `category: desktop-storage`. The category field should match the skill's actual category (matching the directory name pattern `desktop-storage-electron` -> category `desktop-storage`). This mismatch would cause the skill to be filed under the wrong category in the CLI's skill selection UI.

## Fix Applied

Changed `category: desktop-framework` to `category: desktop-storage` in the metadata.yaml file.

## Proposed Standard

Add a validation check (or document in the skill authoring guide) that the `category` field in `metadata.yaml` must match the first two segments of the skill directory name (e.g., `desktop-storage-electron` -> `desktop-storage`). This could be enforced by the CLI's skill validation logic or caught by a lint rule.
