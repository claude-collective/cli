### Remaining TODOs (low priority)

- Init: All domains deselected validation — requires wizard interaction to deselect all domains (edge case)
- Edit: All skills deselected validation — requires wizard interaction to deselect all skills (edge case)
- Init: Dashboard menu Edit execution — requires testing dashboard → Edit → edit command chain (partially covered by `init-wizard-existing`)

## 15. Known Assertion Gaps (fixture limitations)

These assertions SHOULD pass but don't due to test fixture limitations. They are documented as
commented-out assertions with `KNOWN GAP` markers in the test files. When the fixture is extended
to include the missing infrastructure, the assertions should be uncommented.

| Test File                                              | Assertion                                                           | Root Cause                                                                                        |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `interactive/edit-wizard-plugin-migration.e2e.test.ts` | `toHaveCompiledAgent("web-developer")` after local→plugin migration | `createE2EPluginSource` fixture does not include agent definition partials needed for compilation |
| `interactive/init-wizard-default-source.e2e.test.ts`   | `toHaveCompiledAgents()` after plugin-mode init                     | Same fixture limitation — `createE2EPluginSource` has no agent partials                           |
