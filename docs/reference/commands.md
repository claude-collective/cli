# CLI Commands Reference

Every command available in the `agentsinc` CLI. Run `agentsinc <command> --help` for flag help; this doc is the fuller picture: purpose, invocation model, flag semantics, and current gaps.

> **Base flag (most commands):** `--source, -s <path|url>` — Skills source path or URL. Defined on `BaseCommand.baseFlags` and inherited by every command that doesn't override it. **Seven commands override `baseFlags` to `{}`** because `--source` has no meaning there: `doctor`, `build plugins`, `build marketplace`, `new skill`, `import skill`, `search`, `validate`.

## Command matrix

| Command                     | Purpose                                                                  | Interactive | Flags (excl. base)                                                                        |

Interactive = renders an Ink UI. Hybrid = interactive only when prompting for confirmation (`update`).

---

## Core

### `init`

**File:** `src/cli/commands/init.tsx`

Greenfield setup. Detects if already installed (shows dashboard), otherwise opens the wizard: stack → sources → build → agents → confirm. Writes config and compiles agents.

**Flags:** `--refresh` (force remote source re-fetch), `--source` (override skills source).

**When to use:** First run on a machine, or first run inside a project that needs a project-scoped config.

---

### `edit`

**File:** `src/cli/commands/edit.tsx`

Re-enters the wizard with the current selections pre-loaded. Diff is shown at the confirm step. On confirm: re-copies locals, installs/uninstalls plugins, re-writes config, recompiles agents.

**Flags:** `--refresh`, `--source`.

**When to use:** Change skills, agents, scope, or mode after `init`.

---

### `compile`

**File:** `src/cli/commands/compile.ts`

Re-runs the agent compiler using the persisted config. Non-interactive — safe in scripts and CI. Dual-pass (global + project) when both installations exist.

**Flags:** `--verbose`, `--source`.

**When to use:** After hand-editing `config.ts`, after a skill update, or when agents feel stale.

---

### `update [skill]`

**File:** `src/cli/commands/update.tsx`

Pulls the latest skill content from the configured source. With no argument, updates every out-of-date skill after showing a diff and prompting for confirmation. With an argument, updates that one skill only. Always recompiles agents afterward (auto-recompile is the sensible default — users who want finer control can run `cc compile` separately).

**Flags:** `--yes/-y` (skip confirmation), `--source`.

**When to use:** Source marketplace has newer skill revisions than what's on disk.

> **TODO:** Exercise end-to-end against a modified source — confirm the diff view, confirmation prompt, `--yes` bypass, and the single-skill `update <name>` path all behave correctly and that the post-update recompile produces the expected agent output.

---

### `search <query>`

**File:** `src/cli/commands/search.ts`

Read-only catalog browse. Takes one required positional arg and zero flags. Searches every registered source (primary + extras) by `id`, `displayName`, `slug`, `description`, or `category`. Prints an `@oclif/table` with columns ID / Source / Category / Description.

**Flags:** (none — `static flags = {}`, `baseFlags = {}`).

**When to use:** See what skills are available before wiring them into config. For actually installing a skill, use `import skill` (ad-hoc GitHub repo) or the wizard (`init`/`edit`) to add it to your registered sources.

**Multi-source merge:** results include skills from the primary source (matrix) plus every registered extra (fetched via `giget`). Extras show their source name in the `Source` column so you can distinguish them at a glance.

---

## Customization

### `eject <type>`

**File:** `src/cli/commands/eject.ts`

Exports source material for user modification. Types: `agent-partials`, `templates`, `skills`, `all`.

**Flags:** `--force/-f`, `--output/-o` (default: `.claude/` in cwd), `--refresh`, `--source`.

---

### `new skill <name>` ⚠️ disabled

**File:** `src/cli/commands/new/skill.ts`

**Currently disabled behind `FEATURE_FLAGS.NEW_SKILL_COMMAND` (default `false`)** while D-212 is open. Running it exits non-zero with a message pointing at the task. The `scaffoldSkillFiles` library function is NOT gated — `new marketplace` still calls it internally to create its starter skill.

**Why disabled:** post-install the custom skill tries to install as a marketplace plugin and fails (marketplace lookup 404s), config-types regresses from the extend-global shape to a flat listing, and the scaffold command's completion message incorrectly tells users to run `cc compile` (which is a no-op for newly scaffolded skills). See `todo/TODO.md` D-212.

**Behavior when the flag is flipped back on:** scaffolds a `SKILL.md` + `metadata.yaml` in the detected local marketplace (or `.claude/skills/` when not in one). Always sets `custom: true`. Core logic lives in the exported `scaffoldSkillFiles` function, which is also called directly by `new marketplace` for its starter skill. Author resolves via `resolveAuthorOrDefault` (checks user config).

**Flags (when enabled):** `--author/-a`, `--category/-c`, `--domain/-d`, `--force/-f`. Does not inherit `--source` (scaffolding doesn't consume a source).

> **TODO:** Verify the generated `metadata.yaml` satisfies every field the CLI's skill loader expects (`parseFrontmatter`, `skillMetadataSchema`, matrix registration). After scaffolding, the new skill must appear in `agentsinc search`, `agentsinc list`, and in the wizard's skill grid — round-trip test required.

---

### `new agent <name>` ⚠️ disabled

**File:** `src/cli/commands/new/agent.tsx`

**Currently disabled behind `FEATURE_FLAGS.NEW_AGENT_COMMAND` (default `false`)** while D-213 is open. Running it exits non-zero with a message pointing at the task.

**Why disabled:** the command fails immediately for any user whose install doesn't pre-include the `agent-summoner` meta-agent. `new agent` drives Claude via that meta-agent, and the lookup falls back only to a user-registered source. If neither place has it, the command errors with a misleading `"Run 'compile' first"` hint. See `todo/TODO.md` D-213 for the full list of gaps (bundled fallback, output path, install wiring, config-types regression).

**Behavior when the flag is flipped back on:** scaffolds a custom agent under `<projectDir>/.claude/agents/_custom/`. Prompts interactively for purpose unless `--purpose` is provided, then drives Claude (via the `claude` CLI) to draft the agent's identity/playbook/output partials.

**Flags (when enabled):** `--purpose/-p`, `--force/-f`, `--source` (inherited).

**Requires (when enabled):** Anthropic's `claude` CLI on `$PATH` **and** `agent-summoner` resolvable either locally (in `<projectDir>/.claude/agents/`) or in the registered source.

> **TODO:** Same as `new skill` — verify the scaffolded agent produces a valid `metadata.yaml` (agent schema, not skill schema) and that the new agent is picked up by the agent loader, appears in `agentsinc list`, and is selectable in the wizard's agents step. Round-trip test from scaffold → visible in CLI surfaces.

---

### `new marketplace <name>` ⚠️ disabled

**File:** `src/cli/commands/new/marketplace.ts`

**Currently disabled behind `FEATURE_FLAGS.NEW_MARKETPLACE_COMMAND` (default `false`)** while D-214 is open. The scaffold itself works; the problem is what happens when the scaffolded marketplace is later consumed via `cc init --source <that-marketplace>` — matrix composition has ~20 hardening gaps that make consumption unreliable (silent ID overwrites, orphaned custom skills, extras can't participate in relationships, schema drift, etc.). Scaffolding a marketplace today creates infrastructure built on a shaky foundation.

See `todo/TODO.md` D-214 for the full fix list (must-fix, should-fix, nice-to-have) required before flipping the flag.

**Behavior when the flag is flipped back on:** creates a fresh marketplace directory with the three config TS files (`config/skill-categories.ts`, `config/skill-rules.ts`, `config/stacks.ts`), a `package.json`, a README, and a starter skill. The starter skill is scaffolded by calling `scaffoldSkillFiles` directly (not via `runCommand`) — author resolves via `resolveAuthorOrDefault(undefined, parentDir)`, consistent with `new skill`. `build marketplace` is then invoked automatically at the end to produce the initial `marketplace.json`.

**Flags (when enabled):** `--force/-f`, `--source` (inherited).

---

### `import skill <source>`

**File:** `src/cli/commands/import/skill.ts`

Imports skills from a GitHub repo (`github:owner/repo`, `owner/repo`, or URL). Skills dir is hardcoded to `skills/` (no longer a flag). Source fetches go through `giget` with default caching.

**Flags:** `--skill/-n`, `--all/-a`, `--list/-l`, `--force/-f`. Does not inherit `--source` (the positional arg is the source).

**Modes:** `--list` prints available skills; `--skill <name>` imports one; `--all` imports every skill in the repo. At least one must be provided.

> **TODO:** Exercise end-to-end against a real third-party GitHub repo (e.g. `github:vercel-labs/agent-skills`). Confirm `--list`, `--skill`, and `--all` modes, non-standard `--subdir` layouts, and that imported skills land in `.claude/skills/` with `metadata.yaml` that the CLI's loader accepts.

---

## Build (distribution / authoring)

### `build plugins`

**File:** `src/cli/commands/build/plugins.ts`

Compiles skills (and optionally agents) from a source tree into standalone Claude Code plugins. Used by marketplace authors. Skills dir is hardcoded to `src/skills/` (marketplace convention — no longer a flag).

**Flags:** `--agents-dir/-a`, `--output-dir/-o`, `--skill` (single-skill mode), `--verbose/-v`. Does not inherit `--source` (produces plugins from a source, doesn't consume one).

---

### `build marketplace`

**File:** `src/cli/commands/build/marketplace.ts`

Walks `--plugins-dir` and writes a `marketplace.json` describing every plugin. **Reads marketplace identity from `package.json` at cwd** — `name`, `version`, `description` are required fields; `author` is optional (warns when missing but continues).

The `author` field is parsed flexibly:

- String form `"Name <email>"` → `{ name, email }`
- String form `"Name <email> (url)"` (npm's official format, URL discarded) → `{ name, email }`
- String form `"<email>"` (email only, warns) → `{ name: "", email }`
- String form `"Name"` (no brackets, warns) → `{ name }`
- Object form `{ name, email?, url? }` (URL discarded) → passed through

The `MarketplaceIdentity` type is derived from `z.infer<typeof packageJsonSchema>` via `Pick` rather than redeclared.

**Flags:** `--plugins-dir/-p`, `--output/-o`, `--verbose/-v`. Does not inherit `--source`.

**Exit codes:** non-zero when `package.json` is missing at cwd, required fields fail schema validation, or any plugin fails to manifest.

---

## Diagnostics

### `doctor`

**File:** `src/cli/commands/doctor.ts`

Runs health checks: config parse, skills resolved, agents compiled, orphans, installed skill files, source reachable. Exits non-zero if any check fails. No flags — details are always emitted (diagnostic commands shouldn't have a "hide info" mode).

**Per-check resilience:** each check runs inside a `safeCheck(kind, fn)` wrapper — a single throwing check produces a `status: "fail"` result with the error in `details`, rather than killing the whole run. Partial results always surface.

**`CheckKind` discriminator** (`"config" | "skills" | "agents" | "orphans" | "installed" | "source"`) tags every `CheckResult`. `formatTips()` keys remediation hints off `kind`, not message substring — renaming a message can't silently lose a tip.

**Check ordering:** the source reachability check runs first (its side effect populates the global matrix used by later checks). If the source fails, `checkSkillsResolved` is marked **skipped** rather than run against an empty matrix — avoids misleading "all skills missing" reports.

**Flags:** (none — `static flags = {}`). `doctor` overrides `baseFlags` to `{}`, so it does not accept `--source`.

---

### `list`

**File:** `src/cli/commands/list.tsx`

Prints the installation's mode, source, and a scope-grouped skill/agent summary. Ink component when TTY; plain text fallback otherwise.

**Flags:** `--source` (base only).

---

### `validate`

**File:** `src/cli/commands/validate.ts`

Takes no arguments. Runs four validation passes over everything the CLI knows about, aggregates the results into one summary line, and exits non-zero if any pass produced an error.

**Passes (in order):**

1. **Sources** — every source from `resolveAllSources(projectDir)` (primary + extras). Uses `validateSource`, which internally runs six sub-passes over a source tree:
   - **Skills** (`src/skills/**/metadata.yaml` + `SKILL.md`) — schema + pairing + displayName/dirname consistency + snake_case detection
   - **Matrix cross-references** — `checkMatrixHealth` confirms `requires` / `conflictsWith` IDs resolve. Unresolved slugs (a skill's relationship references a slug not in the same source) emit via `warn()` → stderr, always visible.
   - **Stacks** — `src/stacks/*/config.yaml` against `stackConfigValidationSchema`, plus `src/stacks/**/skills/**/metadata.yaml` against `metadataValidationSchema`
   - **Source-side agents** — `src/agents/**/metadata.yaml` against `agentYamlGenerationSchema`
   - **TS config exports** — runtime-loads `config/skill-categories.ts`, `skill-rules.ts`, `stacks.ts` via `loadConfig` and Zod-checks each default export
   - Each sub-pass skips absent targets without error (source shape is flexible — a skills-only source is valid).

   **Remote sources** (`github:owner/repo`, `http(s)://…`, etc.) are skipped with a `— skipped (remote source)` row; only local paths are walked, since the user isn't the author of remote ones.

2. **Plugins** — `~/.claude/plugins/` and `<project>/.claude/plugins/`. Uses `validatePlugin` / `validateAllPlugins`.
3. **Installed skills** — `~/.claude/skills/` and `<project>/.claude/skills/`. Checks each skill has `SKILL.md` + valid `metadata.yaml` against the strict schema (`customMetadataValidationSchema` for `custom: true` entries).
4. **Installed agents** — `~/.claude/agents/*.md` and `<project>/.claude/agents/*.md`. Checks frontmatter parses and required fields are present; enforces kebab-case on `name`.

**Dedup:** when `cwd === $HOME`, the global and project paths resolve to the same directory; the project pass is skipped across **all three** installed-directory passes (plugins, skills, agents) to avoid double-validation. `inHome` is computed once via `fs.realpathSync` on both sides, so macOS symlinked `$HOME` no longer misses the collision.

**Flags:** (none — `static flags = {}`, `static baseFlags = {}`). Zero-arg, zero-flag.

**Exit codes:** `EXIT_CODES.ERROR` if any pass produced an error; `EXIT_CODES.SUCCESS` otherwise. Warnings are reported but non-fatal.

**Sample output:**

```

```

**Constants (file-local, in `validate.ts`):** `COL_NAME_WIDTH`, `COL_URL_WIDTH`, `COL_PATH_WIDTH` for row alignment; `VALIDATE_STATUS.{SKIPPED_REMOTE, NOT_PRESENT, EMPTY, NO_PLUGINS}` for the dashed status markers. `displayDir()` renders absolute paths as `~/...` uniformly across all three installed-directory passes.

> Not to be confused with `doctor`, which validates the **installed state** coherence (orphans, config parse). `validate` is for checking content — sources, plugin bundles, and installed skill/agent files the CLI already knows about.

---

### `uninstall`

**File:** `src/cli/commands/uninstall.tsx`

Removes CLI-managed plugins and compiled agents. With `--all`, also removes `.claude-src/` (the config directory).

**Flags:** `--yes/-y` (skip confirm), `--all` (also remove `.claude-src/`), `--source` (base).

---

## Conventions across commands

- **Exit codes** from `EXIT_CODES`: `SUCCESS = 0`, `ERROR = 1`, `CANCELLED = 2`, `INVALID_ARGS = 2`. Every `this.error()` call passes an explicit code.
- **Base flag `--source`** is inherited by commands that consume a skills source. Seven commands override `baseFlags` to `{}`: `doctor`, `build plugins`, `build marketplace`, `new skill`, `import skill`, `search`, `validate`.
- **Interactive vs non-interactive TTY handling** — `update`, `list`, `new agent` degrade gracefully when `process.stdin.isTTY` is false.
- **`--refresh`** consistently means "ignore cache and fetch from remote". Used only by commands that legitimately re-fetch a source (`init`, `edit`, `update`, `eject`).
- **`--force/-f`** normalized to `"Overwrite existing {noun}"` across scaffolding commands (`new skill`, `new agent`, `new marketplace`, `import skill`).
- **`--verbose/-v`** retained only on `compile`, `build plugins`, `build marketplace`. `doctor` and `validate` always emit full detail (diagnostic commands shouldn't have a hide-info toggle). `search` prints a table, no verbosity levels.

---

## TODOs (per command)

| Command        | TODO                                                                                                                |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `update`       | Exercise end-to-end against a modified source — confirmation, `--yes`, single-skill path.                           |
| `new skill`    | Verify generated `metadata.yaml` passes the skill loader and makes the new skill visible in `search`/`list`/wizard. |
| `new agent`    | Same as `new skill` but for the agent schema — scaffolded agent must show up in `list` and the wizard agents step.  |
| `import skill` | Exercise end-to-end against a real GitHub repo; cover `--list`, `--skill`, `--all`.                                 |

## Known gaps / audit items

Updated 2026-04-15. Tracked here rather than in inline comments.

1. **Scaffolding commands (`new skill`, `new agent`, `new marketplace`) have ~1 E2E test each.** Edge cases (kebab-case validation, existing dirs without `--force`, metadata defaults) are under-covered.
2. **`update` non-TTY behavior** — limited E2E coverage for CI / piped execution (`search` now non-interactive always).
3. **`validate` unresolved-slug warnings don't increment `totals.warnings`.** The message reaches stderr via `warn()` but the validate command's aggregate counter only picks up structured `ValidationResult.warnings`. If you want the counter to reflect these warnings, `validateRegisteredSource` needs to detect that a `warn()` fired during source loading and bump the total. Separate small wiring change.
4. **`getAgentDefinitions(remoteSource?, options?)`** still accepts a first param used only by `new/agent.tsx` to locate a custom `agent-summoner` meta-agent via the user's `--source` flag. Niche feature — custom sources that ship their own meta-agent. Not removing; flagged so it doesn't slip through a future cleanup without deliberate intent.

## AI-docs drift log

Running list of internal `.ai-docs/` references that lag behind the CLI's actual behavior. Tick items off as they're brought up to date. Commands are the primary surface that mutates — every time a command is added, removed, or has its flags changed, the internal map references need a pass.

**Why this exists:** agents rely on these maps to locate code. Stale pointers send them to non-existent files or removed flags and produce broken work. Keep this list fresh — append as drift is discovered.

- [ ] `.ai-docs/DOCUMENTATION_MAP.md` — mentions `doctor --source` and `compile --agent-source` (both removed 2026-04-14). Two `build stack` mentions at lines 606 and 955 are inside historical validation-round log entries; leave those as period-correct records.
- [x] `.ai-docs/reference/boundary-map.md` — `build stack` row removed 2026-04-14. Still verify `doctor --source` / `compile --agent-source` references are stripped.
- [ ] `.ai-docs/reference/commands.md` — two `build stack` entries (table row + per-command detail section at ~line 448).
- [ ] `.ai-docs/reference/dependency-graph.md` — three `build stack` rows (~lines 97, 123, 141).
- [ ] `.ai-docs/reference/testing/e2e-infrastructure.md` — references the deleted `e2e/interactive/build-stack.e2e.test.ts` (~line 102).
- [ ] `.ai-docs/reference/test-infrastructure.md` — same deleted test file (~line 315).
- [ ] `.ai-docs/standards/e2e/page-objects.md` — prose example mentions a "build stack selector" (~line 289).
- [ ] `e2e/TODO-E2E.md` — historical task-tracking log entries for the removed `build stack` (~lines 93–95, 140, 360, 400). Decide whether to prune or leave as history.
- [ ] `.ai-docs/DOCUMENTATION_MAP.md` (~lines 386–387) — references `schema-validator.ts:200` / `:156` with line numbers; `validateAllSchemas` deleted, surviving `formatZodErrors` is now at a different line. Drop line numbers per the "no source code line numbers in .ai-docs" rule and update the symbol list.
- [ ] `.ai-docs/reference/commands.md` (~line 203) — mentions the deleted `validateAllSchemas()`.
- [ ] `.ai-docs/reference/dependency-graph.md` (~line 117) — lists `validateAllSchemas, printValidationResults` under `validate`; both deleted.
- [ ] **0.129.0 flag removals** — any `.ai-docs/` that enumerates CLI flags needs a sweep for: `doctor --verbose`, `build plugins --skills-dir`, `build marketplace --name/--version/--description/--owner-name/--owner-email`, `new skill --output`, `new agent --non-interactive/--refresh`, `import skill --subdir/--refresh`, `search --interactive/--category/--refresh/--json`, `validate --verbose`. All removed; `--source` inheritance now overridden on 7 commands.
- [ ] **Deleted production files (0.129.0)** — `src/cli/components/skill-search/` (entire dir), `src/cli/components/hooks/use-filtered-results.ts`. If `.ai-docs/reference/*` listed these as parts of the component graph, remove.
- [ ] **Post-0.129.0 additional flag/code removals** — `edit --agent-source`, `new marketplace --output`, `resolveAgentsSource` helper + error message, `formatOrigin` + `AgentsSourceOrigin` type, `loadAgentDefs`'s first `agentSource` parameter, `SUCCESS_MESSAGES.IMPORT_COMPLETE`, `HOTKEY_COPY_LINK`, `UI_LAYOUT` consts block. Sweep any `.ai-docs/` that references these symbols.
- [ ] **Unresolved-slug diagnostic** — `src/cli/lib/matrix/skill-resolution.ts`'s unresolved-slug log call flipped from `verbose()` to `warn()`. Any `.ai-docs/` describing the matrix-resolution silent-drop behavior needs to note it now warns to stderr.
- [ ] **`skills-matrix.yaml` is dead** — not referenced anywhere in `src/`, not created by any scaffolding command. Matrix data now lives in `config/skill-categories.ts` + `config/skill-rules.ts` + `config/stacks.ts` + per-skill `metadata.yaml`. Cleanup needed:
  - `.ai-docs/reference/features/skills-and-matrix.md` — name and content likely both reference the YAML. Rewrite to describe the TS-file composition, or rename to `skills-and-matrix-config.md` and prune the YAML sections.
  - Any other `.ai-docs/` with `skills-matrix.yaml` references — grep `grep -rn "skills-matrix" .ai-docs/` before touching.
  - Changelogs retain their period-correct mentions — leave alone.
- [ ] **When `new skill` / `new agent` metadata generation is hardened** (see TODOs) — update any skill-loading or agent-loading reference docs that describe the current schema expectations.
