# Architecture

A rough overview of the Agents Inc. CLI codebase. For granular implementation details, see the verified documentation in [`.ai-docs/`](../../.ai-docs/DOCUMENTATION_MAP.md).

## Overview

Agents Inc. CLI (`agentsinc`) is a TypeScript CLI that manages AI agent configurations for Claude Code. It loads skill definitions from a marketplace, lets users select technology stacks via an interactive terminal wizard, compiles agent prompts from Liquid templates with selected skills injected, and installs the results as Claude plugins or local files.

```

## Core Data Flow

```
1. User runs command (e.g., `agentsinc init`)

2. oclif init hook runs
   -> Extracts --source from raw argv
   -> resolveSource() determines skills source
   -> Attaches ResolvedConfig to oclif config object

3. Command loads skills matrix
   -> loadSkillsMatrixFromSource() fetches categories, rules, skills
   -> Returns SourceLoadResult (merged matrix + source config)

4. Wizard renders (Ink/React)
   -> Zustand store manages step-by-step state
   -> Steps: stack -> skills -> sources -> agents -> confirm
   -> Returns WizardResultV2 (selected skills, agent configs, scope settings)

5. Installation
   -> installLocal() or installPluginConfig()
   -> Copies skills to project, generates TypeScript config
   -> writeScopedConfigs() splits config into global + project scopes

6. Compilation
   -> Reads agent partials (intro.md, workflow.md, etc.)
   -> Builds template context from selected skills
   -> Sanitizes to prevent Liquid injection
   -> LiquidJS renders agent.liquid template
   -> Output: .claude/agents/{name}.md
```

## Key Architectural Patterns

- **BaseCommand**: All commands extend `BaseCommand` which provides the `--source` flag, `sourceConfig` getter (populated by init hook), and error handling with named `EXIT_CODES`.

- **Init hook**: Runs before every command. Resolves the skills source and attaches config to oclif's config object. When no command is given and a project is already initialized, shows a dashboard.

- **Source resolution precedence**: `--source` flag > `CC_SOURCE` env var > `.claude-src/config.ts` (project) > `~/.claude-src/config.ts` (global) > default marketplace.

- **Install modes**: Skills can be installed as **Claude plugins** (managed by Claude's plugin system) or **locally** (copied to `.claude/skills/`). Agents are always written to `.claude/agents/`. Config is always at `.claude-src/config.ts`.

- **Liquid template compilation**: Agent prompts are compiled from partials using LiquidJS. Template root resolution checks project-level overrides first, then built-in templates.

- **Zod at boundaries**: All YAML/JSON parsing uses Zod schemas from `schemas.ts`. Lenient schemas (`.passthrough()`) at loading boundaries, strict schemas for validation. Bridge pattern (`z.ZodType<ExistingType>`) ensures runtime matches compile-time types.

- **Multi-source system**: Skills can come from multiple sources (public marketplace, private repos, local files). Each `ResolvedSkill` tracks all available sources and which is active. Users can mix public skills with private alternatives per-skill via the wizard's Sources step.

- **Generated types**: Union types (`SkillId`, `Domain`, `Category`, `AgentName`, etc.) are auto-generated from the skills source into `types/generated/`. Runtime type guards validate strings against these unions.

## Configuration

Source resolution follows a 5-tier precedence (flag > env > project > global > default). Project config is TypeScript loaded via jiti:

```typescript
// .claude-src/config.ts
import { defineConfig } from "@agents-inc/cli/config";

export default defineConfig({
  skills: [
    { id: "web-framework-react", scope: "project" },
    { id: "web-styling-tailwind", scope: "global" },
  ],
  agents: [{ name: "web-developer", scope: "project", model: "sonnet" }],
});
```

| Install Mode | Skills Location     | Agents Location   | Config                  |
| ------------ | ------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------- |
| local        | `.claude/skills/`   | `.claude/agents/` | `.claude-src/config.ts` |
| plugin       | Claude plugin cache | `.claude/agents/` | `.claude-src/config.ts` |

## Agent Compilation

Agent prompts are assembled from partials (YAML frontmatter + markdown sections like `intro.md`, `workflow.md`, `skills.md`). The compiler reads agent definitions, builds a template context with all selected skills injected, sanitizes user-controlled fields to prevent Liquid injection (`{{`, `{%` stripped), and renders through LiquidJS. Output is one markdown file per agent in `.claude/agents/`.

## Test Infrastructure

| Layer       | Config Project         | Scope                                           |
| ----------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Unit        | `unit`                 | Pure functions, isolated logic with mocked deps |
| Integration | `integration`          | Cross-module interactions, real file system     |
| Commands    | `commands`             | oclif command execution via `runCommand()`      |
| E2E         | `e2e/vitest.config.ts` | Full CLI flows with real terminal interaction   |

E2E tests cover 5 categories: commands, interactive wizards, lifecycle flows, integration scenarios, and smoke tests. Test data uses factories from `__tests__/helpers.ts` and canonical fixtures from `__tests__/mock-data/`.

## Conventions

- **Strict TypeScript** with zero-`any` policy. No `@ts-ignore` without justification.
- **Named exports only** (no default exports). `.js` extensions on relative imports.
- **kebab-case** for all files and directories.
- **Zod at parse boundaries** for all external data (YAML, JSON, CLI args).
- **Remeda over imperative loops** for data transformations.
- **Domain-driven modules** in `lib/` with barrel `index.ts` exports.
- **Named constants** for exit codes, paths, colors, symbols, file size limits (no magic numbers).
- **Type guards** (`isCategory()`, `isDomain()`, etc.) instead of `as` casts for runtime narrowing.
