1. NEVER write implementation code or edit test files directly. Always delegate to CLI developer or CLI tester. No exceptions for "small" or "quick" fixes.

2. When delegating to a sub-agent, tell it to read CLAUDE.md before starting work.

3. After any fix, trace ALL scenarios through the code before calling it done.

4. ALWAYS read [.ai-docs/DOCUMENTATION_MAP.md](./.ai-docs/DOCUMENTATION_MAP.md) before working on any area of the codebase. It indexes verified documentation for every major system.

5. NEVER run ANY git commands that modify the staging area or working tree — no `git add`, `git reset`, `git stash`, `git checkout`, `git restore`, `git clean`. The user curates their staging area intentionally. This applies to sub-agents too — explicitly forbid git commands when delegating.

## Workspace Directories

| Directory                          | Purpose                                               |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `/home/vince/dev/cli`              | CLI tool (this repo) - entry point for all operations |
| `/home/vince/dev/skills`           | Plugin marketplace - skills, agents, stacks           |
| `/home/vince/dev/cv-launch`        | Test project - install targets for testing            |

## NEVER do this

### Git & Workflow
- NEVER run ANY git command that modifies the staging area or working tree (`git add`, `git reset`, `git stash`, `git checkout`, `git restore`, `git clean`)
- NEVER use git worktrees (`isolation: "worktree"`)
- NEVER use `git checkout`, `git restore`, or any command that discards working tree changes — ask the user how to proceed
- NEVER introduce new workflow patterns (tools, flags, strategies) that the user hasn't explicitly requested
- NEVER put machine-specific absolute paths in any file tracked by git

### Type Safety & Casts
- NEVER use `as SkillId` or `as SkillSlug` casts on valid union members — the literal string IS the type. Only cast at parse boundaries (YAML, JSON, CLI args) or for deliberately invalid error-path test data (testing that bad IDs produce errors). Fabricated test IDs that aren't in the union should use `string` type, not casts.
- NEVER use `as unknown as T` double casts — fix the upstream type instead
- NEVER use `{} as Record<K, V>` — use `const x: Partial<Record<K, V>> = {}` with a type annotation
- NEVER use `matrix.skills[id]!` non-null assertions — use `getSkillById(id)` from `matrix-provider.ts`

### Data Integrity
- NEVER use optional chaining (`?.`) or null coalescing (`?? ""`, `|| []`) on data that must exist — use asserting lookups. Silent fallbacks hide bugs.
- NEVER build multi-tier resolution fallbacks (try exact → try alias → try directory name). Data matches on the first lookup or it's an error.
- NEVER fall back to `path.basename(dir)` as a skill ID — use `frontmatter.name` from `parseFrontmatter()`
- NEVER derive `slug` from skill ID or directory path — `slug` is a required field in metadata, always pass it explicitly
- NEVER add backward-compatibility shims or legacy fallbacks — the project is pre-1.0. Remove old code cleanly.

### Scope Awareness (project vs global)
- NEVER hardcode `projectDir` for skill/agent paths when a skill has a `scope` field — use `os.homedir()` for `"global"` scope, `projectDir` for `"project"` scope
- NEVER use `path.join(projectDir, LOCAL_SKILLS_PATH)` without checking scope — global-scoped local skills live at `~/.claude/skills/`, not `<project>/.claude/skills/`
- NEVER load global local skills as a fallback only when project has none — always merge both project and global local skills (project takes precedence on conflict)
- NEVER pass a uniform scope to `claudePluginInstall`/`claudePluginUninstall` for multiple skills — each skill has its own scope in its `SkillConfig`
- NEVER let a marketplace `primarySource` override a user's saved `source` in config — saved source (`"local"` or marketplace name) always takes priority over computed defaults
- NEVER use conditional fallbacks like `if (x.length === 0) { use fallback }` when both primary and fallback data should always be merged

### Test Data
- NEVER construct test data inline — use factories from `__tests__/helpers.ts` and fixtures from `create-test-source.ts`. If a factory doesn't exist, create one.
- NEVER create custom mock skills when a canonical `SKILLS.*` entry from `test-fixtures.ts` would work
- NEVER call `createMockMatrix(SKILLS.react)` inline when a pre-built constant exists in `mock-matrices.ts`
- NEVER pass the entire `SKILLS` registry to `createMockMatrix` — spread individual entries
- NEVER construct `ProjectConfig`, `ProjectSourceConfig`, or `AgentScopeConfig[]` inline — use `buildProjectConfig()`, `buildSourceConfig()`, `buildAgentConfigs()`
- NEVER write inline SKILL.md frontmatter or agent YAML template strings — use `renderSkillMd()`, `renderAgentYaml()` from `content-generators.ts`
- NEVER repeat agent metadata strings inline — use `AGENT_DEFS` from `mock-agents.ts`
- NEVER put TODO/task IDs in test `describe()` blocks
- NEVER define path/timeout/text constants locally in E2E test files — use `DIRS`, `FILES`, `TIMEOUTS`, `SOURCE_PATHS`, `STEP_TEXT`, `EXIT_CODES` from `e2e/pages/constants.ts`
- NEVER write a helper function in an E2E test file without first grepping `e2e/helpers/test-utils.ts` and `e2e/fixtures/` for an existing one

### Code Style
- NEVER create redundant type aliases — use `Pick<>`, `Partial<>`, or `&`. Check `types/` first.
- NEVER add unnecessary comments — only when unintuitive, complex, or for edge cases
- NEVER reassign constants to other constants — use the original directly
- NEVER build intermediate data structures imperatively — use `.map()`, `.flatMap()`, or literal arrays
- NEVER export constants only used within the same file — run grep before adding `export`

## ALWAYS do this

### Delegation & Process
- ALWAYS delegate implementation and test code to sub-agents. Tell them to read CLAUDE.md. Tell them: "Do NOT run any git commands."
- ALWAYS trace ALL scenarios through the code after any fix
- ALWAYS grep for the old value when changing test data or renaming anything
- ALWAYS search for all call sites when removing a workaround
- When a task is deferred, ALWAYS move it to `TODO-deferred.md` — never delete
- ALWAYS write a finding to `.ai-docs/agent-findings/` when a sub-agent fixes an anti-pattern, discovers a missing standard, or notices convention drift — use the template from `.ai-docs/agent-findings/TEMPLATE.md`
- ALWAYS tell sub-agents: "If you fix an anti-pattern or discover a missing standard, write a finding to `.ai-docs/agent-findings/` using the template in `.ai-docs/agent-findings/TEMPLATE.md`"

### Scope Awareness
- ALWAYS use `resolveInstallPaths(projectDir, scope)` with the explicit scope parameter when resolving skill/agent directories
- ALWAYS split skill lists by scope (`filter(s => s.scope === "global")` / `filter(s => s.scope !== "global")`) before any path-dependent operation (copy, delete, install, uninstall)
- ALWAYS load both project AND global local skills and merge them — see `source-loader.ts` and `compile.ts` for the correct pattern
- ALWAYS preserve saved `source` from config over computed `primarySource` when restoring wizard state — `saved?.source ?? primarySource ?? DEFAULT_PUBLIC_SOURCE_NAME`

### Type Safety
- ALWAYS use type guards (`isCategory()`, `isDomain()`, `isAgentName()` from `utils/type-guards.ts`) instead of `as` casts for runtime narrowing
- ALWAYS use `getSkillById(id)` or `getSkillBySlug(slug)` from `matrix-provider.ts` for skill lookups where the skill must exist. Only use `matrix.skills[id]` when genuinely optional.
- ALWAYS use `parseFrontmatter()` from `lib/loading/loader.ts` for SKILL.md parsing
- ALWAYS type factory function parameters with the narrowest union type (`SkillId`, not `string`). Error-path tests cast at the call site.
- ALWAYS use `typedEntries()` / `typedKeys()` from `utils/typed-object.ts` (not raw `Object.entries()`)

### Test Data
- ALWAYS prefer `SKILLS.*` from `test-fixtures.ts` over `createMockSkill()` for standard domain skills
- ALWAYS use `createMockMatrix` spread syntax: `createMockMatrix(SKILLS.react, SKILLS.hono)`
- ALWAYS use spread isolation `{ ...SKILLS.react }` when passing to functions that mutate objects in-place
- ALWAYS use pre-built matrix constants from `mock-matrices.ts` instead of inline `createMockMatrix(SKILLS.*)` calls
- ALWAYS use config factories: `buildProjectConfig()`, `buildSourceConfig()`, `buildAgentConfigs()`, `buildSkillConfigs()`
- ALWAYS use `AGENT_DEFS` from `mock-agents.ts` for agent metadata
- When fixing test data, ALWAYS evaluate the construction pattern too, not just the values
- ALWAYS read `.ai-docs/standards/e2e/README.md` before writing or modifying E2E tests
- ALWAYS use `toStrictEqual` (not `toEqual`) for object and array comparisons in assertions

## Test Data Factories

Use factories from `__tests__/helpers.ts` and constants from `__tests__/mock-data/`. Grep for `createMock*`, `build*`, `SKILLS.*`, `AGENT_DEFS.*`, `render*` to find what's available. Never inline test data — if a factory doesn't exist, create one.

```
Is it a complete skill/agent/category object?
├─ YES → Use factory from helpers.ts (createMockSkill, createMockAgent, createMockCategory)
└─ NO → Is it a full project directory structure?
    ├─ YES → Use createTestSource() from fixtures/create-test-source.ts
    └─ NO → Does it create a config, matrix, or stack?
        ├─ YES → Use a factory (createMockMatrix, buildWizardResult, etc.) — NEVER inline
        └─ NO → Is it a partial object for one test case?
            ├─ YES → Inline is fine
            └─ NO → Use factory with overrides parameter
```

## Code Conventions

- **File naming:** kebab-case for ALL files and directories
- **Exports:** Named exports only (no default exports). Use `.js` extensions on relative imports in new files.
- **Constants:** No magic numbers or hardcoded strings — use `STANDARD_FILES.*`, `STANDARD_DIRS.*`, `EXIT_CODES.*`, `UI_SYMBOLS.*`, `CLI_COLORS.*` from `consts.ts`
- **Error handling:** `getErrorMessage(error)` for unknown errors, `this.handleError(error)` in commands, `EXIT_CODES.*` constants, no silent catch blocks
- **Logging:** `warn()` for user issues, `verbose()` for diagnostics, `log()` for always-visible
- **TypeScript:** Zero `any` without justification, no `@ts-ignore` without comment, Zod schemas at parse boundaries, all remaining casts must have comments explaining why
